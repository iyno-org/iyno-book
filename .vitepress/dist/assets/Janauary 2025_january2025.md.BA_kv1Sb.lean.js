I didn&#39;t know that ssh connection command was ssh <strong>-i key</strong> but it is fine now as it is working. Moodle has been installed and it is functional. I have also created a course named Problem-Based Learning Neuroanatomy. The following is the course description for it:</p><p><em>The Problem-Based Learning (PBL) Neuroanatomy course is designed to engage students in active, student-centered learning that emphasizes clinical relevance and application. By integrating PBL techniques, this course provides a foundational understanding of neuroanatomy while encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving skills.</em></p><p><em>The curriculum covers gross anatomy, microanatomy (histology), and functional anatomy (physiology) in a structured, clinically focused manner. Non-essential details are provided as supplementary resources, allowing students to focus on core concepts without feeling overwhelmed.</em></p><p><em>The course also highlights the connections between neuroanatomy and related disciplines, including neuroscience, neurology, neuropathology, and neurosurgery. Real-world clinical scenarios and case studies are incorporated to illustrate how neuroanatomical knowledge is applied in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological conditions. By linking anatomical details to their practical use in the daily lives of neurologists and neurosurgeons, the course fosters a deeper appreciation for the subject and its significance in the medical field.</em></p><p><em>The Problem-Based Learning (PBL) Neuroanatomy course is designed to engage students in active, student-centered learning that emphasizes clinical relevance and application.
