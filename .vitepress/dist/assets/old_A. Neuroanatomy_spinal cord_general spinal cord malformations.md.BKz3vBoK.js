He is a student who recently completed a period of intensive studying, involving prolonged sitting at his desk. The patient acknowledges being in poor physical condition. On the day following his exams, he decided to clean his room, which he had neglected during his study period. While attempting to lift and move his desk to vacuum the floor, he experienced a sudden, sharp back pain that radiated to his right lower leg. In distress, he called 911.
