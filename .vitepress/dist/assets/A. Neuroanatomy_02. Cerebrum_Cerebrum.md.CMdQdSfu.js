It is divided into two large hemispheres. The hemispheres are connected by ‘bridges of nerve bundles’. The cerebral surface has deep folds which is known as the cerebral cortex. These folds increase the surface area of the brain allowing to fit more neurons.</p><p>The deepest of these grooves between the folds can also be used as landmarks to localize other brain regions.</p><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Details</p></div><p>The cerebrum consists of the diencephalon and the cerebral hemispheres. The later are just discussed right now.</p><p>The cerebral hemispheres are separated by a deep midline fissure, the longitudinal cerebral fissure. The fissure contains a fold of dura mater, the falx cerebri. The fissure also contains the anterior cerebral arteries. Deep inside this fissure, the corpus callosum (the largest ‘bridge of nerve bundles’) connects the hemispheres. Another deep fissure that divides the cerebellum and the cerebrum is the tentorium cerebelli.</p><p>The folds on the surface of the cerebral cortex are known as gyri, which are seperated from each other by sulci.</p><p>The important sulci that can be used as landmarks are:</p><ol><li>central sulcus</li><li>lateral sulcus</li><li>parieto-occipital sulcus</li><li>calcarine sulcus</li></ol><p>The central sulcus is of great importance because the gyrus that lies anterior to it is the premotor cortex (precentral gyrus). The gyrus that lies posterior to it contains the somatosensory cortex (the postcentral sulcus).</p><p>There is also the concept of the contralateral brain control. This states that the left hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body. The central sulcus runs on the lateral surface of the hemispheres but it does not reach the lateral sulcus. There is a little connection between the frontal and parietal lobes.</p><p>The lateral sulcus is a deep cleft found mainly on the inferior and lateral surfaces of the cerebral hemisphere. It consists of a short stem that divides into three rami, the anterior horizontal, anterior ascending and posterior rami.</p><p>The parieto-occipital sulcus begins on the superior medial margin of each hemisphere. It passes downward and anteriorly to meet the calcarine sulcus.</p><p>The calcarine sulcus starts under the posterior end of the corpus callosum and turns around the corpus callosum to reach the occipital lobe. Sometimes, the calcarine sulcus appears on the lateral surface of the hemispheres. Approximately midway along the length of the calcarine sulcus, the parieto-occipital sulcus joins it.</p><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Advanced</p></div><p>The surface is the highly convoluted mass of gray matter beneath which lies the extensive inner mass of white matter. That white matter contains the basal ganglia. The cerebral hemispheres contain the lateral ventricles, which are connected by the third ventricle which is connected to the fourth ventricle.</p><p>The cerebral hemispheres contain primary motor and sensory areas. The frontal lobe also consists of the areas for personality and planning. The limbic system in the cerebrum is concerned with memory and emotions.</p><p>The cerebral hemispheres are divided by a large medial fissure the ‘Median Longitudinal Fissure’. The dura mater is folded inward forming the falx cerebri.</p><p>The superolateral surface follows the concavity of the vault. The medial surface is flat and divided by the longitudinal fissure. The inferior surface is divided into the orbital and tentorial surfaces.</p><p>The lateral sulcus has a stem that divides into 3 rami. This stem commences inferiorly at the anterior perforated substance. It extends between the anterior surface of the frontal lobe and the anterior pole of the temporal lobe. It also accomodates the sphenopartietal sinus. This stem upon reaching the lateral surface of the brain divides into the anterior horizontal, anterior ascending and posterior rami.</p><p>The anterior horizontal and horizontal ascending travel 2.5 cm into the inferior frontal gyrus. The posterior ramus is the largest and runs for about 7 cm. The lateral sulcus accomodates the middle cerebral vessels.</p><p>The central sulcus marks the areas of the primary motor and primary sensory cortex. In the left hemisphere, the areas around the anterior horizonal and anterior ascending rami, the broca’s motor speech area is present.</p><p>The curved anterior part of the corpus callosum is the genu, the end in the rostrum, the middle part is the trunk or body and the posterior part is the splenium.</p><p>In front of the lamina terminalis is the paraterminal gyrus. This is a small triangle of gray matter which is separated from the rest of the cortex through the posterior paraolfactory sulcus. The anterior paraolfactory sulcus may occur anterior to the paraterminal gurus. The cortex between the anterior and posterior paraolfactory gyri is the subcallosal area (paraolfactory gyrus).</p>',24),i=[o];function n(h,l,c,u,p,d){return r(),t("div",null,i)}const b=e(s,[["render",n]]);export{f as __pageData,b as default};
