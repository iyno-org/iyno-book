# Overview
It is roughly cylindrical in shape. It begins in the foramen magnum and is the continuation of the medulla oblongata. It ends at the level of the first lumbar vertebra in adult humans, at the third lumbar vertebra in babies and at the fifth lumbar vertrebra in fetus.

The spinal cord is surrounded by three layers of meninges: the dura, arachnoid and pia mater. The space between the arachnoid and the pia mater contains the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF). In the cervical region and the lumbar region where the cord gives rise to the plexuses. Inferiorly, the spinal cord tapers off into the conus medularis. After this is only the elongation of the pia mater, the filum terminale.

The surface of the spinal cord has two depressions, the deeper anterior median fissure and the posterior mode shallow posterior median sulcus.

Along the entire length of the spinal cord, there are 31 pairs of spinal roots. They are anterior (or ventral or motor) and posterior (or dorsal or sensory) spinal roots. Each posterior nerve root possesses a posterior root ganglion.

## Macroscopic structure
the spinal cord has an outer covering of white matter and inner gray matter. 

the spinal cord can be seen to contain anterior and posterior two gray columns or horns which are connected by a thin gray commissure. This area also contains the central canal.

"a small lateral gray horn is present at the thoracic and lumbar levels". the cervical and lumbar enlargements contain the greatest amount of gray matter as they innervate the largest number of muscles. 

## Microscopic structure
the spinal cord consists of nerve cells and their processes (dendrites), the neuroglia and blood vessels. These nerve cells are multipolar. The neuroglia form a network around the nerve cells.

### anterior gray column
The neurons in the anterior gray column are large, multipolar cells that pass out in the anterior roots of the spinal nerves as alpha efferents. These nerve fibers innervate skeletal muscles. Smaller nerve cells' fibers pass out as gamma efferents.

For purposes of description, the anterior gray column can be divided into the medial, central and lateral groups.

The medial group contains neurons that innervate the muscles of the trunk and neck.

The central group contains neurons that in the cervical region have neurons that innervate the diaphragm known as the phrenic nucleus. The upper five or six segments of the cervical spinal segments innervate the sternocleidomastoid and the trapezius and are known as the accessory nucleus.

The lateral group is present in the cervical and lumbosacral segments and these innervate the muscles of the limbs.
posterior gray column

Two nerve cell groups are located only in the thoracic and lumbar segments while the other two are located in the entire length of the spinal cord.

The substantia gelatinosa group is situated at the apex of the posterior horn and it is composed mostly of type II Golgi neurons. It receives afferent sensory fibers concerned with pain, temperature and touch from the posterior root (which is sensory in fibers).

The nucleus proprius is a group that is present thoughout the length of the spinal cord, and is anterior to the substantia gelatinosa group of nerve cells. They are mainly concerned with position and movement (proprioception), two point discrimination and vibration.

The nucleus dorsalis is present from levels C8 to L3 and is mainly concerned with proprioception.

The lateral visceral afferent nucleus is present lateral to the neucleus dorsalis and is mainly concerned with visceral afferent information.

Then there is the intermediolateral group of nerve cells.
