I now remember that I also run an organization :). Anyaways, I am now writing out a new case for the tract pathologies chapter.

*A medicine student after passing his neuroanatomy examination over-speeds on his way home on the road. Unfortunately, he crashes his car into a tree. After the trauma surgeons stabilize him, he is seen by a neurosurgeon. The surgeon notes the fracture dislocation of the ninth cervical vertebra with signs and symptoms of severe damage to the spinal cord#note([If you would like to learn more about how the surgeon correctly identified the level of the vertebra just by functional signs, see Case 2.]).*

*On physical examination, he has paralysis of the left leg with loss of sensation. Upon testing for cutaneous sensibility, he has a round band of hyperesthesia around the abdominal wall on the left side of the umbilicus. On the right side, he has total loss of sensation from the level of the umbilicus downward including the right leg. State the level at which the spinal cord was damaged (not the spinal vertebral level but the spinal cord level). Was the spinal cord completely sectioned or not? Also, explain the sensory and motor disturbances the student was experiencing.*

This is what I wrote today. I hope I can also add some images of this case with ChatGPT, speaking of which .... 

Sorry, but Saqib has left the website!! :)

Started hetzner step and it is complete now. I didn't know that ssh connection command was ssh **-i key** but it is fine now as it is working. Moodle has been installed and it is functional. I have also created a course named Problem-Based Learning Neuroanatomy. The following is the course description for it:

*The Problem-Based Learning (PBL) Neuroanatomy course is designed to engage students in active, student-centered learning that emphasizes clinical relevance and application. By integrating PBL techniques, this course provides a foundational understanding of neuroanatomy while encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving skills.*

*The curriculum covers gross anatomy, microanatomy (histology), and functional anatomy (physiology) in a structured, clinically focused manner. Non-essential details are provided as supplementary resources, allowing students to focus on core concepts without feeling overwhelmed.*

*The course also highlights the connections between neuroanatomy and related disciplines, including neuroscience, neurology, neuropathology, and neurosurgery. Real-world clinical scenarios and case studies are incorporated to illustrate how neuroanatomical knowledge is applied in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological conditions. By linking anatomical details to their practical use in the daily lives of neurologists and neurosurgeons, the course fosters a deeper appreciation for the subject and its significance in the medical field.*

**Tomorrow, Inshallah all of the text in the pdfs of HOLISTIC CLINICAL NEUROSURGERY will be written inside the moodle course.**
