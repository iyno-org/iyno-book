# Objective
The objective of this chapter, is to make you understand why this book exists and why it is different. This chapter also serves as an entry point to the world of Neurosurgery and how to navigate the information dense forest of the internet age.

## Why I started writing this book?
A lot of neurosurgical books are intended for Neurosurgical professionals. Many books of Neurosurgery (and medicine in general) appear more as newspapers rather than books in the traditional sense (with engaging figures and dense tables).

Neurosurgery Simplified attempts to change that. This book is designed to be as engaging as possible while containing all the essential Neurosurgical knowledge to succeed as a beginner.
