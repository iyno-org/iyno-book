### Corticospinal Tract
The Corticospinal Tract fibers originate in the Precentral gyrus of the brain. They travel through the Internal capule and the corona radiata reaching the ventral (backside) of the pons. Here is where this chapter begins. These fibers then arrange in the pons to form the medullary pyramids and for this reason, the corticospinal tract is also known as the pyramidal tract.

The transition to the spinal cord occurs at the cervico-medullary junction which is at the level of the foramen magnum. This is the point where almost all of the fibers of the cortico-spinal fibers decussate producing the 'Great Pyramidal Decussation'. The fibers enter the lateral corticospinal tracts after this decussation.

An important observation here is that the fibers in the corticospinal tract that control movement in the upper extremeties are located more medial than the fibers that control movements of the muscles of the lower half of the body. Finally, these axons enter the gray matter of the spinal cord to synapse with them and carry the nerve impulses to the muscles for contraction.

### Fasciculus cuneatus and Gracilis

Thick (greater diameter) axons carrying postural and vibrational sense enter the spinal cord at the posterior column. This is the posterior column-medial lemniscal pathway.

The posterior column axons travel all the way to the posterior column nuclei in the medulla. See the following figure for a visualization. The fibers stack onto the lateral side of the tract. So the tract initially has only has the fibers from the lower limbs which is known as the fasciculus gracilis. The fibers from the upper body and the limbs add onto the side which are called the fasciculus cuneatus. These tracts are even visible on the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata where they are called the gracile tubercle (from the fasciculus gracilis) and the cuneate tubercle (from the fasciculus cuneatus).

These are the first order neurons. They travel from the spinal cord towards the fasciculi in the medulla oblongata where they reach their respective nuclei (the nucleus gracilis and the nucleus cuneatus).
