Added the following text:
The corticospinal tract, also known as the pyramidal tract, is a critical pathway for voluntary motor control. It originates in the **Precentral Gyrus** of the brain, located in the primary motor cortex. From there, the fibers travel through the **Corona Radiata**, a fan-shaped collection of white matter fibers, and then converge into the **Internal Capsule**, a compact bundle of pathways. Continuing their descent, these fibers reach the ventral portion of the **Pons**, where this chapter begins.

In the pons, the fibers become dispersed and intermingle with other neural pathways. This dispersion is essential for facilitating communication with various cranial nerve nuclei, allowing for integrated motor control. As the fibers progress downward, they regroup within the **Medulla Oblongata**, forming the **Medullary Pyramids**. These longitudinally oriented ridges are prominently visible on the anterior surface of the medulla and are the reason the corticospinal tract is also called the pyramidal tract.

At the lower border of the medulla, approximately 85-90% of these fibers cross to the opposite side in a process known as the **decussation of the pyramids**. This crossing forms the **lateral corticospinal tract**, which is primarily responsible for the control of limb movements. The remaining fibers, which do not decussate, contribute to the **anterior corticospinal tract**, primarily involved in the control of axial muscles.

The transition to the spinal cord occurs at the **cervico-medullary junction**, located at the level of the foramen magnum. This is where nearly all the fibers undergo the decussation process, commonly referred to as the **Great Pyramidal Decussation**, before entering the **lateral corticospinal tracts**. These fibers then continue their descent through the spinal cord, synapsing with **lower motor neurons** located in the anterior horn. These lower motor neurons are responsible for directly innervating skeletal muscles, enabling voluntary movements.

An important structural detail is the somatotopic organization within the corticospinal tract. Fibers controlling movements of the upper extremities are located more medially, while those controlling the lower extremities are positioned more laterally. Upon reaching their target levels in the spinal cord, the axons of the corticospinal fibers enter the **gray matter** and synapse with lower motor neurons. These neurons transmit nerve impulses to muscles, initiating contraction and enabling precise and voluntary movement.

Fixed some spelling mistakes and made the github commit. Wrote everything in the typst online editor. Also added the image from wikipedia. Also thought about how to write sidenotes in the image page. Its relatively easy as I can write a caption below the image and then write sidenotes in it. I also write numbered:false in the caption so that I don't have a really long list of numbers in the caption.

### Corticospinal Tract
The Corticospinal Tract fibers originate in the Precentral gyrus of the brain. They travel through the Internal capsule and the corona radiata reaching the ventral (backside) of the pons. Here is where this chapter begins. These fibers then arrange in the pons to form the medullary pyramids and for this reason, the corticospinal tract is also known as the pyramidal tract.

The transition to the spinal cord occurs at the cervico-medullary junction which is at the level of the foramen magnum. This is the point where almost all of the fibers of the cortico-spinal fibers decussate producing the 'Great Pyramidal Decussation'. The fibers enter the lateral corticospinal tracts after this decussation.

An important observation here is that the fibers in the corticospinal tract that control movement in the upper extremities are located more medial than the fibers that control movements of the muscles of the lower half of the body. Finally, these axons enter the gray matter of the spinal cord to synapse with them and carry the nerve impulses to the muscles for contraction.

### Fasciculus cuneatus and Gracilis

Thick (greater diameter) axons carrying postural and vibrational sense enter the spinal cord at the posterior column. This is the posterior column-medial lemniscal pathway.

The posterior column axons travel all the way to the posterior column nuclei in the medulla. See the following figure for a visualization. The fibers stack onto the lateral side of the tract. So the tract initially has only has the fibers from the lower limbs which is known as the fasciculus gracilis. The fibers from the upper body and the limbs add onto the side which are called the fasciculus cuneatus. These tracts are even visible on the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata where they are called the gracile tubercle (from the fasciculus gracilis) and the cuneate tubercle (from the fasciculus cuneatus).

These are the first order neurons. They travel from the spinal cord towards the fasciculi in the medulla oblongata where they reach their respective nuclei (the nucleus gracilis and the nucleus cuneatus).
