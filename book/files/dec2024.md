# Fasciculus cuneatus and Gracilis

Thick (greater diameter) axons carrying postural and vibrational sense enter the spinal cord at the posterior column. This is the posterior column-medial lemniscal pathway.

The posterior column axons travel all the way to the posterior column nuclei in the medulla. See the following figure for a visualization. The fibers stack onto the lateral side of the tract. So the tract initially has only has the fibers from the lower limbs which is known as the fasciculus gracilis. The fibers from the upper body and the limbs add onto the side which are called the fasciculus cuneatus. These tracts are even visible on the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata where they are called the gracile tubercle (from the fasciculus gracilis) and the cuneate tubercle (from the fasciculus cuneatus).

These are the first order neurons. They travel from the spinal cord towards the fasciculi in the medulla oblongata where they reach their respective nuclei (the nucleus gracilis and the nucleus cuneatus).
