## Why this Book is being written?

The genesis of this book stems from a noticeable gap in the current literature. Most neurosurgical books cater primarily to seasoned professionals in the field. They often resemble newspapers more than traditional, engaging books, filled with complex figures and dense tables that can be daunting for beginners.

"Neurosurgery Simplified" aims to break this mold. The goal is to create a resource that is both engaging and accessible, yet comprehensive enough to cover all essential knowledge for those new to the field of neurosurgery. 

A significant issue with traditional textbooks is their tendency to present all relevant material upfront without explaining its practical importance. This approach can make the learning process feel abstract and disconnected from real-world applications. In contrast, "Neurosurgery Simplified" introduces relevant clinical encounters at the beginning of each section. This method not only piques student interest but also provides a conceptual framework for understanding how to manage various clinical conditions.

Our hope is that this book will serve as a complete guide for your studies in neurosurgery. It is designed to be as engaging as possible, making the complex field of neurosurgery approachable and understandable for beginners. 

So, without further ado, let’s embark on this journey together. Welcome to "Neurosurgery Simplified." Let’s get started!
