# Chapter 2: Gross and General Spinal Cord Malformations
## Case Presentation 1

A patient presents with a complaint of severe back pain. He is a student who recently completed a period of intensive studying, involving prolonged sitting at his desk. The patient acknowledges being in poor physical condition. On the day following his exams, he decided to clean his room, which he had neglected during his study period. While attempting to lift and move his desk to vacuum the floor, he experienced a sudden, sharp back pain that radiated to his right lower leg. In distress, he called 911. Paramedics responded promptly and transported him to the neurological department, where you are the neurosurgeon on call.


### Relevant anatomical background
This is the case of lumbar disk herniation. Now to understand these terms, we need to first learn more about the general structure of the spinal cord and its organization.

#### Overview
The spinal cord is situated within the vertebral canal of the vertebral column and is surrounded by three coverings known as the meninges.
The spinal cord is like a cylinder begins at the end of the brain and ends in the lumbar region of the vertebral column.

::: details Difference between the vertebral column, vertebral canal and the spinal cord.
Vertebral column: the bony structure that houses the spinal cord.

Vertebral canal: the space inside the vertebral column that contains the spinal cord.

The spinal cord is the nervous tissue itself.
:::

The spinal cord is organized into nerve roots each of which exit from the gaps within the vertebral column. One such gap is visible in Figure 1.

Along the entire length of the spinal cord, 31 pairs of spinal nerves consist of the anterior or ventral or motor roots and the posterior or dorsal or sensory roots. Each root also contains the dorsal root ganglion, the cells of which give rise to peripheral and central nerve fibers.

Now coming back to the question of the medical student;s injury, the herniation occurred on the right side and was relatively small. This herniation occurred between L5 and S1 spinal cord levels and the posterior (dorsal) roots of the spinal cord were compressed. The image
